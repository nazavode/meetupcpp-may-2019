# Look ma, no CUDA! Programming GPUs with modern C++

This repo contains all the stuff used during the talk I gave at the
[Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/) meetup in 
[Modena, 2019-05-09](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/meetup-maggio2019/).
Please feel free to steal everything you want.

## Contents

Please note that some submodules are needed to have all the stuff working properly, be
sure to `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

In order to be able to build the examples based on SYCL you
