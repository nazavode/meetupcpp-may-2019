# Look ma, no CUDA!

This repo contains all the stuff used during the talk I gave at the [Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/) meetup in [Modena, ????](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/meetup-dicembre2018/). Please feel free to steal everything you want.

Please note that some submodules are needed to have all the stuff working properly, be sure to `git clone --recursive`.
