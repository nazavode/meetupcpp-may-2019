# Look ma, no CUDA! Programming GPUs with modern C++

This repo contains all the stuff used during the talk I gave at the
[Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/) meetup in 
[Modena, 2019-05-09](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/meetup-maggio2019/).
Please feel free to steal everything you want.

## Contents

Please note that some submodules are needed to have all the stuff working properly, be
sure to `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

| Path        | What to expect |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `slides/`   | The slide deck. Nothing more, nothing less. |
| `examples/` | Show me the code. |
| `cmake/`    | CMake helpers, mainly intended to support [ComputeCpp](https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp) and directly copied from its distribution. |
| `external/` | All `git` submodules related to external dependencies. |

## Getting Started

The [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) provided in this repo tries to build the following examples
as separate executables:

| Example | Depends on | WAT? |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| [`vector_add_sycl.cpp`](examples/vector_add_sycl.cpp) | `SYCL` | Parallel vector addition with linear accessors |
| [`vector_add_sycl_serial.cpp`](examples/vector_add_sycl_serial.cpp) | `SYCL` | Serial vector addition with linear accessors | 
| [`vector_add_tmp_sycl.cpp`](examples/vector_add_tmp_sycl.cpp) | `SYCL` | Templated (on value type) parallel vector addition with linear accessors |
| [`vector_add_tmp_sycl_serial.cpp`](examples/vector_add_tmp_sycl_serial.cpp)| `SYCL` | Templated (on value type) serial vector addition with linear accessors |
| [`vector_add_opencl.cpp`](examples/vector_add_opencl.cpp)| `OpenCL` | Parallel vector addition with linear data space |
| [`vector_add_cuda.cu`](examples/vector_add_cuda.cu) | `CUDA` | Parallel vector addition with linear data space |
| [`matrix_add_sycl.cpp`](examples/matrix_add_sycl.cpp)| `SYCL` | Matrix (2-dimensions) parallel addition with 2-dimensional accessors |

All the examples based on SYCL have been tested with the following implementations:

 * [`triSYCL`](https://github.com/triSYCL/triSYCL), the open source, standard reference implementation;
 * [`ComputeCpp`](https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp), a commercial implementation by [codeplay](https://www.codeplay.com/) with a freely available community edition.

### Build

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MEETUPCPP_SYCL`        | `triSYCL`                 | SYCL implementation to be used; allowed values are: `triSYCL`, `ComputeCpp`                        |
| `MEETUPCPP_TRISYCL_DIR` | `<repo>/external/triSYCL` | Path of the `triSYCL` source to be used when `triSYCL` is selected; defaults to vendored submodule |
| `COMPUTECPP_BITCODE`    | `ptx64`                   | Bitcode generation target for ComputeCpp; defaults to NVIDIA PTX                                   |
| `TRISYCL_OPENCL`        | `ON`                      | Use `OpenCL` execution backend; ignored when `MEETUPCPP_SYCL` isn't set to `triSYCL`               |

## Credits

A lot of excellent graphics and pitches have been taken directly from publicly available
talks across the net, I've strived really hard to put proper credits on the slides,
so thanks everyone for your help in making my slides more clear and understandable.

I'm particularly grateful to (in order of appearance):

* [Karl Rupp](https://www.karlrupp.net/)
* [Michael Wong](https://wongmichael.com/about/)
* [Gordon Brown](http://www.aerialmantis.co.uk/)
* [Aksel Alpay](https://github.com/illuhad)

## Resources

* [Accelerating your C++ on GPU with SYCL by Simon Brand](https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/sycl/) - one of the nicest introductions around.
* [Programming GPUs with SYCL by Gordon Brown](http://cppedinburgh.uk/slides/201607-sycl.pdf) - a great introduction to the whys and hows of SYCL.
* [SYCL Developer Guide by Codeplay](https://developer.codeplay.com/products/computecpp/ce/guides/sycl-guide?) - the current lack of learning material about SYCL is appalling but this terse developer guide makes the situation a little better.
* [CppCon 2018: Parallel Programming with Modern C++ by Gordon Brown](https://github.com/AerialMantis/cppcon2018-parallelism-class) - a great overview of parallel programming and modern C++.
* [Modern C++ for accelerators: a SYCL deep dive by Andrew Richards](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2018-evs/EVS2018_09_Modern_Cpp_for_accelerators_andrew.pdf) - an excellent slide deck to be printed and annotated.
* [2019 EuroLLVM Developersâ€™ Meeting: A. Savonichev (Intel) "SYCL compiler: zero-cost abstraction and type safety for heterogeneous computing"](https://youtu.be/rfg19iODkhI) - a nice insight on how Intel is working on his own SYCL implementation for LLVM; mandatory for compiler nerds.
* [SYCL 1.2.1 API Reference Card](https://www.khronos.org/files/sycl/sycl-12-reference-card.pdf) - print and hang it on the wall next to the Picasso you just bought.
* [SYCL Standard Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/) - to be a proper standard, you need a proper spec. Not so *standardese* (actually quite educational) but definitely not a novel.
