# Look ma, no CUDA! - Programming GPUs with *modern* C++

This repo contains all the stuff used during the talk I gave at the
[Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/) meetup in 
[Modena, 2019-05-09](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/meetup-maggio2019/).
Please feel free to steal everything you want.

## Contents

Please note that some submodules are needed to have all the stuff working properly, be
sure to `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

* [Accelerating your C++ on GPU with SYCL](https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/sycl/) by @tartanllama - one of the nicest introductions around.
* [SYCL 1.2.1 API Reference Card](https://www.khronos.org/files/sycl/sycl-12-reference-card.pdf) - print and hang it on the wall next to the Picasso you just bought.
* [SYCL Standard Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/) - to be a proper standard, you need a proper spec. Not so *standardese* (actually quite educational) but definitely not a novel.
